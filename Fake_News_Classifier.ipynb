Basically, O Reilly told Carson  it would take a miracle. Even after an embarrassing loss in the South Carolina primary on Saturday, Carson couldn t come to terms that his campaign was over. He not only told his supporters that he had just as many delegates as the other candidates (aside from the winner, of course), but continued to keep up this act with O Reilly.While trying to convince O Reilly (and possibly himself) that with just  one more point  he would have come in third, O Reilly got fed up with Carson s denial tactics and decided to give him the cold, hard truth. He said: You know me, I m a fairly straight forward guy. It would take a miracle for not only you but John Kasich, at this point, with the delegate situation being what it is, to overcome Trump. While O Reilly still felt there might be hope that Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) could give Trump a run for his money, O Reilly said to Carson, But for you. Very difficult. It was like O Reilly was speaking to a wall, because Carson continued to believe  a lot of things can happen  and that with only five GOP candidates now, he could be more successful when America focuses on the issues over  personalities. O Reilly kept taking Carson off cloud nine and putting him back into reality, where it was becoming clear that Carson should soon be dropping out of the presidential race. Noting that March 1st was a crucial date for Carson, O Reilly said: You know, doc, I gotta tell ya, I just don t think you re gonna do it. It s not you. It s history. It s almost like Governor Bush in a sense that it was just the wrong time for Governor Bush up against the colossus. Carson reluctantly agreed with O Reilly, but mentioned that Bill Clinton didn t emerge as a success until after the sixth contest   and O Reilly shut him down once again. It became clear that O Reilly already thinks Carson s campaign is over when he asked Carson who he d be endorsing after he drops out. Carson didn t have an answer, and probably isn t ready to accept defeat, but it s clear that he should start thinking about it.You can watch O Reilly break Carson s heart below: Featured image via video screen capture \",\n          \"Only hours before he is set to deliver the last State of the Union Address of his historic presidency, President Obama found time to lampoon Donald Trump s chances of becoming president.The Today Show asked President Obama if he could possibly imagine a scenario where Trump wins on Election Day in November, only to receive a ten word quip in response.  Well, I can imagine it   in a  Saturday Night  skit,  Obama hilariously said.Then President Obama took a serious tone and warned that anything is possible. After all, who would have ever predicted that George W. Bush would use the conservative-leaning Supreme Court to steal the 2000 Election? That s why Obama warned Americans to not be complacent, essentially telling them that staying home on Election Day could give Trump the victory ever has nightmares about. But Obama was also expressed faith that Americans would reject Trump and his hateful rhetoric. I m pretty confident that the overwhelming majority of Americans are looking for the kind of politics that does feed our hopes and not our fears, that does work together and doesn t try to divide is that isn t looking for simplistic solutions and scapegoating. Vice-President Joe Biden was also interviewed by Today, and he warned that allowing Trump to become president would only make America weaker. He is divisive   I think he d have to acknowledge that he s very divisive   and that s not healthy. We always do best when we act as one America. We always do poorly when we appeal to our fears and our differences. Here s the video via Today.Trump currently enjoys a wide lead in New Hampshire and has regained the lead in some Iowa polls over Ted Cruz. It s not decided yet, but Trump appears to be heading toward becoming the Republican presidential nominee and he ll either face Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in a general election that is sure to be one of the nastiest presidential contests in history. Some Democrats have suggested that they will stay home if their preferred Democratic candidate is not on the ballot. And that is precisely the kind of complacency and irresponsibility that President Obama just warned against because that kind of divide is exactly what would let Trump become the leader of the free world with a Republican-dominated House and Senate instead of keeping him in Saturday Night Live skits where he belongs.Featured Image: Instagram \",\n          \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IioEIUmawRo\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ben carson got reality check really like fellow conservative bill reillyon monday night edition reilly factor host delivered hard soulcrushing facts republican presidential candidate improbable would win gop nomination basically reilly told carson would take miracle even embarrassing loss south carolina primary saturday carson come terms campaign told supporters many delegates candidates aside winner course continued keep act reillywhile trying convince reilly possibly one point would come third reilly got fed carson denial tactics decided give cold hard truth said know fairly straight forward guy would take miracle john kasich point delegate situation overcome trump reilly still felt might hope sens marco rubio rfl ted cruz rtx could give trump run money reilly said carson difficult like reilly speaking wall carson continued believe lot things happen five gop candidates could successful america focuses issues personalities reilly kept taking carson cloud nine putting back reality becoming clear carson soon dropping presidential race noting march st crucial date carson reilly said know doc gotta tell ya think gonna history almost like governor bush sense wrong time governor bush colossus carson reluctantly agreed reilly mentioned bill clinton emerge success sixth contest reilly shut became clear reilly already thinks carson campaign asked carson endorsing drops carson answer probably ready accept defeat clear start thinking ityou watch reilly break carson heart featured image via video screen capture\",\n          \"hours set deliver last state union address historic presidency president obama found time lampoon donald trump chances becoming presidentthe today show asked president obama could possibly imagine scenario trump wins election day november receive ten word quip response well imagine saturday night skit obama hilariously saidthen president obama took serious tone warned anything possible would ever predicted george w bush would use conservativeleaning supreme court steal election obama warned americans complacent essentially telling staying home election day could give trump victory ever nightmares obama also expressed faith americans would reject trump hateful rhetoric pretty confident overwhelming majority americans looking kind politics feed hopes fears work together try divide looking simplistic solutions scapegoating vicepresident joe biden also interviewed today warned allowing trump become president would make america weaker divisive think acknowledge divisive healthy always best act one america always poorly appeal fears differences video via todaytrump currently enjoys wide lead new hampshire regained lead iowa polls ted cruz decided yet trump appears heading toward becoming republican presidential nominee either face hillary clinton bernie sanders general election sure one nastiest presidential contests history democrats suggested stay home preferred democratic candidate ballot precisely kind complacency irresponsibility president obama warned kind divide exactly would let trump become leader free world republicandominated house senate instead keeping saturday night live skits belongsfeatured image instagram\",\n          \"httpswwwyoutubecomwatchviioeiumawro\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
